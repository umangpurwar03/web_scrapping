Most agents are self-employed, which means they earn 100% of their commissions. </p><p>‍</p><p>If you like working with people but don’t want to be a customer service representative, selling insurance might be a good option for you. To start your agency, you’ll need about $3,000 to get started; plan on staying at it for about three years before reaching breakeven. Then you can apply your earnings toward a new car or motorcycle! Or consider leasing out space in your office space so other agents can use it when your turn is over—just make sure that what you say about yourself is true!</p><p>‍</p><h2>2.

Online marketing is at its most basic when it comes to organic search. You want people looking for your products or services online, and then you want them to find your site first. </p><p>‍</p><p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is key here, and that’s a job for an expert—and while there are many good SEO firms out there (one of which we profile in Best Places to Work 2018), if you have a specific service or product that needs attention from a local perspective, it might be easier and more cost-effective for you to handle SEO yourself. Sure, SEO may take time, but if done correctly it can pay off immensely with higher rankings on Google and other search engines.</p><p>‍</p><h2>4. Babysitting</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"A women is taking care of two childrens.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/629afdc3cfe6190cf662e788_Babysitting.jpeg\"/></div></figure><p>The best part about babysitting is that it’s an easy way to make some extra cash on nights and weekends while helping people out. Find a family who has young children, ask around for regular gigs, and spread your word through friends or social media. You can also create a Facebook group where parents can post babysitting jobs they need to be done. </p><p>‍</p><p>Join up with a few families and make it into a business! Once you get going, you could even offer paid services—I can vouch for how hard it is to find trustworthy babysitters in your area. (Maybe that's why I haven't hired one yet?) But if you build up enough trust with families, you could set yourself apart by adding new services like cleaning houses or doing grocery shopping on occasion.</p><p>‍</p><h2>5. Computer Software &amp; Hardware</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"Motherboard of a computer is displayed.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62972ad00a56e73872a3fe02_computer%20parts.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>The demand for Computer Software and Hardware services is increasing every year. This is one of those businesses that you can start with a small investment, as long as you know where to find low-cost resources for your inventory. As your business grows, so will your need for employee assistance. Hiring full-time employees (instead of independent contractors) will help you build a stronger company—it can also help you save on taxes and avoid some insurance hassles. </p><p>‍</p><p>You must create a legal structure (either an LLC or a corporation) before bringing on any staff members—you don’t want anyone to have ownership rights over your business ideas or products! </p><p>‍</p><h2>6. Pet-sitting</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"A girl is playing with her pet dog.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62a30a66d78858492f7dd2c0_pet.jpeg\"/></div></figure><p>In most big cities, people are very busy and simply don’t have time to take care of their pets. If you have some love for animals and extra time on your hands, pet-sitting could be a great way to make a little money in exchange for companionship. </p><p>‍</p><p>As long as you have room in your home for a few extra sets of paws, there are all sorts of online websites that can help connect you with local pet owners looking for overnight or full-time caretakers for their cats, dogs, turtles and more.</p><p>‍</p><h2>7. Consultancy</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"Two persons are looking at laptop placed on the table.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62a2d066656e97eec9f4cad7_Consulting%20Business%E2%80%8D.jpeg\"/></div></figure><p>Consulting is one of those professions that has an oddly negative connotation. If a person isn’t quite sure what they want to do, consulting will always be there—but nobody ever wants to pursue it. This may be true, but anyone with a technical background can be an expert consultant if they want. Consulting simply means that you are being paid for your knowledge or services and not necessarily your ability to implement those things yourself. </p><p>‍</p><p>You could be making six figures as a consultant and working 20 hours per week with very little experience in a subject matter area you love! Want to start part-time? That’s possible too! There are tons of people who work freelance consulting jobs after school as well as professionals who have been doing it for years. </p><p>‍</p><h2>8. Pet Grooming</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"A women is cutting nails of the pet dog.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62945cdc37a719286063fa8a_PET%20CARE.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>According to some estimates, pet grooming is one of the fastest-growing industries for small businesses. If you’re a dog or cat lover and have an eye for detail, then starting your own pet grooming business might be a great idea for you. Pet owners from around your community are sure to line up when they hear how well you groom their furry friends. You can easily find advice on how to start a pet grooming business online. </p><p>‍</p><p>Here's a quick primer on getting started: Put together as much information about your pet-grooming services as possible—address any concerns potential customers may have and make it easy for them to contact you and set up an appointment. </p><p>‍</p><h2>9. Lamaze Educator</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"A pregnant women is holding her womb.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62ce579d7a9d54036f2a894a_lamaze.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>As a child development major and former teacher, I’ve been around kids a lot. But it wasn’t until I became an educator for a well-known pregnancy brand that I was lucky enough to learn about all of the amazing benefits surrounding birth and babies. </p><p>‍</p><p>The more time I spent with families, newborns, and expecting parents, I saw firsthand how many opportunities there are for other people interested in working with babies — as doulas (birth coaches), maternity photographers, massage therapists or lactation consultants, just to name a few. If you have an interest or passion for being involved with expectant families during one of life’s most incredible moments, consider these small business ideas</p><p>‍</p><h2>10. Salon Services</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"Barbers are cutting hairs in the salon.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/629891f1dc04e61d157a543d_salon.jpeg\"/></div></figure><p>If you have a talent for hair, nails, or makeup and think you’d be good at running a salon business from home, consider starting your own. Some services include haircuts, mani-pedis and waxing. </p><p>‍</p><p>In addition to those listed here, others might fit your talents such as braiding and facial massage. Of course, it helps if you already have an existing client; get creative with what services you can offer based on other interests and hobbies.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2084pxpx\"><a class=\"w-inline-block\" href=\"https://platform.fynd.com/demo?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=in_blog_Banner\" target=\"_blank\"><div><img alt=\" Fynd platform banner for free demo \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62946d3d03bb89267b289258_Ad%20banner_4.jpg\"/></div></a></figure><p>‍</p><h2>11.

Think of it as marketing research that also benefits your brand — and gives you new customers!</p><p>‍</p><h2>12. Organic and Natural Cosmetics</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"A women is purchasing cosmetic items.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/629875e92df6b709d44a656d_Cosmetics%20and%20Jewellery%20Store.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>Beauty trends are constantly evolving and you can capitalize on these changes by starting a company that sells organic and natural cosmetics. As people become more health conscious, they’re looking for products that are free of chemicals, preservatives, and artificial colours. This is an evergreen industry because it deals with basic human needs. </p><p>‍</p><p>Additionally, you have plenty of room to experiment with colour, scents, and packaging—there’s even demand designer lipsticks!  Think about what kinds of beauty products might be well-received among customers in your area (your local colleges or malls will give you some good hints). The possibilities are endless!</p><p>‍</p><h2>13. Antique Business</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"Antique watch with chains are hanging in the store.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62bad69ff285bf223504ea08_antique.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>If you’re looking for something that gives a more defined return on investment, consider becoming an antique dealer. Starting an antique business isn’t as complex as it may seem—all you need is time and dedication. You’ll also need a good eye for spotting vintage items that people are ready to buy. According to CNN, starting your online antique store can earn you around $1,000 per month by leveraging current trends while still making sure you keep prices reasonable.  </p><p>‍</p><p>Whatever your plan, working with old products will always be valuable because of their quality and appeal; they tend to become rarer over time due to misuse or simple decay, meaning they’ll always have value.</p><p>‍</p><h2>14. Tarot Card Reading</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"A women having tattoo is reading cards.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62ce60a2a40e9b30be691715_card.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>Tarot Card readings are great for entrepreneurs looking for some insight into their business and future. If you can’t afford a $200-an-hour coach, you can use a free deck of tarot cards. To keep things simple, go with three cards (past, present and future) or pick one major problem in your life and interpret every card around it. </p><p>‍</p><p>Draw one card a day—for example, draw a card on Monday and interpret its meaning for that day only; then, draw another on Tuesday, interpret it Tuesday’s significance; Wednesday’s etc. When you run out of cards (or get stuck), start again from the beginning. </p><p>‍</p><h2>15.

Use your creativity to design a variety of interesting, eye-catching T-shirt designs that will get people’s attention and ensure them express their personality or stand out from their limited space.  </p><p>‍</p><p>You can also do similar things by creating cool wall art or simple decorative signs for companies or events (with enough luck, you could even start something like Friskis &amp; Svettis—Plus, fun fact: we assure them). T-shirts are an affordable product that anyone can make and sell; there's no bulk manufacturing involved at any point so it doesn't cost thousands of dollars upfront.</p><p>‍</p><div class=\"w-embed w-script\"><!DOCTYPE html>\n",

Why not put that skill to use as a travel agent? Put together packages for friends, co-workers, or clients who want a special trip but don’t know where they want to go. Book travel plans and tours when they need them and show them how travelling is more fun when it’s shared with those you love. </p><p>‍</p><p>You can be an independent contractor for an agency or reach out directly to people through your business website. Either way, it makes sense financially if you’re able to build up at least 25 regular clients. Some agencies might even allow you to take on some of their high-profile clients, who typically book well in advance.</p><p>‍</p><h2>31.

Your favourites (chips, pretzels, popcorn) are easy enough, but why not try some new foods? Here are a few suggestions: Sprinkle a handful of cheese and dehydrated vegetables on top of sliced fruit like mango or papaya. Then heat it by popping it into your toaster oven. </p><p>‍</p><p>At home, buy packages of bacon and cook them in a pan until they're crispy; let cool and eat as is or crumble over salads. You could also keep cooked bacon chilled and ready for snacking all week long using an ice cube tray. Boil an egg or two each Sunday afternoon and take out one per day during the week.</p><p>‍</p><h2>32.

However, don’t just bring any old electrician onto your property—choose a licensed professional who specializes in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) or electrical work. </p><p>‍</p><p>You should also consider hiring a company that can provide all of your HVAC/electrical needs so that you get one-stop shopping for all of your office comfort needs.

And keep in mind that you will likely want help from an accountant for everything from bookkeeping to filing taxes. Luckily there are plenty of online resources available for those just getting their small business ideas off of paper and into action.</p><p>‍</p><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:2084pxpx\"><a class=\"w-inline-block\" href=\"https://platform.fynd.com/demo?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=in_blog_Banner\" target=\"_blank\"><div><img alt=\" Fynd platform banner for free demo \" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62946d3d03bb89267b289258_Ad%20banner_4.jpg\"/></div></a></figure><p>‍</p><h2>39.

The work of a recruitment agency differs from an executive search firm because recruiters focus on finding employees for specific jobs, whereas headhunters try to fill entire leadership teams at once. </p><p>‍</p><p>If you’re looking for a new career opportunity, several startups can help, but it is important to find one that has appropriate licensing and accreditation. You can also consider launching your recruitment agency; while you will need to be licensed with relevant agencies like your state government, running such an agency takes little more than a few well-placed ads and some elbow grease (translation: clients).  </p><p>‍</p><p>It's also worth noting that there are two types of recruiters - contingency recruiters and retainer recruiters.</p><p>‍</p><h2>41. Tax &amp; Accounting Service</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"Taxation papers and some coins are placed on the table.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62bed35504acdf54c2b87bd9_tax.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>If you’re a do-it-yourself tax filer, why not make it easy on yourself? Hire a professional tax service and have peace of mind that your taxes are filed correctly. If you’re having trouble finding clients for your small business, think about signing up with an online aggregator, such as an accounting service or social media management company. </p><p>‍</p><p>This is also an opportunity to cross-sell additional services to your existing customers. Tax services can be surprisingly lucrative for self-employed individuals and pros often have more time on their hands than other professionals who charge by their hour.</p><p>‍</p><h2>42.

There are all sorts of ways you can monetize your presence here, through branded content, affiliate marketing, social media optimization, and more. But don’t just take our word for it.  </p><p>‍</p><p>Research various agencies and determine which will best suit your goals (e.g., agency A specializes in branded content campaigns while agency B specializes in organic reach). Reach out and see how they can help you put your social media skills to work.</p><p>‍</p><h2>43.

You can charge for wedding photos, and taking pictures of properties, scenery, and wildlife. Drones have quickly become one of the best ways to earn extra income from home. </p><p>‍</p><h2>44. Seasonal Business</h2><figure class=\"w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth\" style=\"max-width:800pxpx\"><div><img alt=\"Family members are enjoying diwali by sparkles.\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/60e3eea63871951801a505d5/62cd058ae7488925d75ab310_diwali.jpg\"/></div></figure><p>Creating a seasonal business is a great way to make money, but it’s also a ton of work. If you run, say, a Christmas tree lot, you can start that up right after New Year’s (maybe even opening early if there are some other Christmas tree lots on your street). Just be prepared for an influx of customers as soon as Halloween and Thanksgiving are over.  </p><p>‍</p><p>On one hand, that means more money. On the other hand, though: it will mean less time and less sleep because now you’re working through some of your busiest seasons.</p><p>‍</p><h2>45.

But it’s no guarantee of success—just ask any franchisee. Choose your franchisor carefully and understand what you’re getting into before making any decisions or writing any checks. </p><p>‍</p><p>If you plan on franchising, make sure you write a clear franchise disclosure document that lays out all details and fees involved. This will help ensure that both parties are operating from an informed position, helping avoid costly miscommunications down the road.</p><p>‍</p><div class=\"w-embed w-script\"><!DOCTYPE html>\n",

Not really. You have a shop window through which you can sell products or services, but do not have an inventory of those items or space for production. You drop ship these items from another source and thus, don’t hold any value. </p><p>‍</p><p>Since there is no investment on your end, <a href=\"https://platform.fynd.com/blog/dropshipping-in-india\" target=\"_blank\">dropshipping</a> is a great way to make money if you want to test out a product idea or market demand before going into heavy costs. One thing that’s worth noting here: It takes a lot of skill and hard work (or rather time) to find suppliers that will take on orders from individuals with no history as well as with no business credentials at all.</p><p>‍</p><h2>47.

You can either go for freshwater or saltwater aquariums. And you don’t even need much capital to start it. It is just like any other average shop; if your business grows big, you can also sell those fish online. </p><p>‍</p><h2>48.

This was our list of famous and successful startups and entrepreneurs from Patna(Bihar). \\u200dBusiness Ideas In PatnaHope this list will help you in having a business idea which you can start on your own.1. Insurance AgentsInsurance companies look for agents who have a proven track record of sales, customer service, and leadership. Most agents are self-employed, which means they earn 100% of their commissions. \\u200dIf you like working with people but don’t want to be a customer service representative, selling insurance might be a good option for you. To start your agency, you’ll need about $3,000 to get started; plan on staying at it for about three years before reaching breakeven. Then you can apply your earnings toward a new car or motorcycle! Or consider leasing out space in your office space so other agents can use it when your turn is over—just make sure that what you say about yourself is true!\\u200d2. Online Tuition ClassesAccording to Skill India’s survey report of 2015, online tutoring is one of the most promising new opportunities for entrepreneurship. If you’re good at explaining difficult concepts and have the ability for helping people learn, consider teaching math, science, English or any other subjects online. \\u200dSites like TutorVista or TutorChat let you sign up as a tutor and chat with potential students from around your city—the perfect way to bring extra income into your life while still working full-time.

Online MarketingIf you want your business to grow online, you need an established online presence. Online marketing is at its most basic when it comes to organic search. You want people looking for your products or services online, and then you want them to find your site first. \\u200dSearch engine optimization (SEO) is key here, and that’s a job for an expert—and while there are many good SEO firms out there (one of which we profile in Best Places to Work 2018), if you have a specific service or product that needs attention from a local perspective, it might be easier and more cost-effective for you to handle SEO yourself. Sure, SEO may take time, but if done correctly it can pay off immensely with higher rankings on Google and other search engines.\\u200d4. BabysittingThe best part about babysitting is that it’s an easy way to make some extra cash on nights and weekends while helping people out. Find a family who has young children, ask around for regular gigs, and spread your word through friends or social media. You can also create a Facebook group where parents can post babysitting jobs they need to be done. \\u200dJoin up with a few families and make it into a business! Once you get going, you could even offer paid services—I can vouch for how hard it is to find trustworthy babysitters in your area. (Maybe that\\'s why I haven\\'t hired one yet?) But if you build up enough trust with families, you could set yourself apart by adding new services like cleaning houses or doing grocery shopping on occasion.\\u200d5. Computer Software & HardwareThe demand for Computer Software and Hardware services is increasing every year. This is one of those businesses that you can start with a small investment, as long as you know where to find low-cost resources for your inventory. As your business grows, so will your need for employee assistance. Hiring full-time employees (instead of independent contractors) will help you build a stronger company—it can also help you save on taxes and avoid some insurance hassles. \\u200dYou must create a legal structure (either an LLC or a corporation) before bringing on any staff members—you don’t want anyone to have ownership rights over your business ideas or products! \\u200d6. Pet-sittingIn most big cities, people are very busy and simply don’t have time to take care of their pets. If you have some love for animals and extra time on your hands, pet-sitting could be a great way to make a little money in exchange for companionship. \\u200dAs long as you have room in your home for a few extra sets of paws, there are all sorts of online websites that can help connect you with local pet owners looking for overnight or full-time caretakers for their cats, dogs, turtles and more.\\u200d7. ConsultancyConsulting is one of those professions that has an oddly negative connotation. If a person isn’t quite sure what they want to do, consulting will always be there—but nobody ever wants to pursue it. This may be true, but anyone with a technical background can be an expert consultant if they want. Consulting simply means that you are being paid for your knowledge or services and not necessarily your ability to implement those things yourself. \\u200dYou could be making six figures as a consultant and working 20 hours per week with very little experience in a subject matter area you love! Want to start part-time? That’s possible too! There are tons of people who work freelance consulting jobs after school as well as professionals who have been doing it for years. \\u200d8. Pet GroomingAccording to some estimates, pet grooming is one of the fastest-growing industries for small businesses. If you’re a dog or cat lover and have an eye for detail, then starting your own pet grooming business might be a great idea for you. Pet owners from around your community are sure to line up when they hear how well you groom their furry friends. You can easily find advice on how to start a pet grooming business online. \\u200dHere\\'s a quick primer on getting started: Put together as much information about your pet-grooming services as possible—address any concerns potential customers may have and make it easy for them to contact you and set up an appointment. \\u200d9. Lamaze EducatorAs a child development major and former teacher, I’ve been around kids a lot. But it wasn’t until I became an educator for a well-known pregnancy brand that I was lucky enough to learn about all of the amazing benefits surrounding birth and babies. \\u200dThe more time I spent with families, newborns, and expecting parents, I saw firsthand how many opportunities there are for other people interested in working with babies — as doulas (birth coaches), maternity photographers, massage therapists or lactation consultants, just to name a few. If you have an interest or passion for being involved with expectant families during one of life’s most incredible moments, consider these small business ideas\\u200d10. Salon ServicesIf you have a talent for hair, nails, or makeup and think you’d be good at running a salon business from home, consider starting your own. Some services include haircuts, mani-pedis and waxing. \\u200dIn addition to those listed here, others might fit your talents such as braiding and facial massage. Of course, it helps if you already have an existing client; get creative with what services you can offer based on other interests and hobbies.\\u200d\\u200d11. Personalised GiftsBuyers love it when a company asks them questions about themselves.They’re more likely to purchase from that brand, and they’ll be happy to tell their friends about their experience. \\u200dThe key is making sure you ask your customers open-ended questions that will elicit more than one-word answers. Think of it as marketing research that also benefits your brand — and gives you new customers!\\u200d12. Organic and Natural CosmeticsBeauty trends are constantly evolving and you can capitalize on these changes by starting a company that sells organic and natural cosmetics. As people become more health conscious, they’re looking for products that are free of chemicals, preservatives, and artificial colours. This is an evergreen industry because it deals with basic human needs. \\u200dAdditionally, you have plenty of room to experiment with colour, scents, and packaging—there’s even demand designer lipsticks! \\xa0Think about what kinds of beauty products might be well-received among customers in your area (your local colleges or malls will give you some good hints). The possibilities are endless!\\u200d13. Antique BusinessIf you’re looking for something that gives a more defined return on investment, consider becoming an antique dealer. Starting an antique business isn’t as complex as it may seem—all you need is time and dedication. You’ll also need a good eye for spotting vintage items that people are ready to buy. According to CNN, starting your online antique store can earn you around $1,000 per month by leveraging current trends while still making sure you keep prices reasonable. \\xa0\\u200dWhatever your plan, working with old products will always be valuable because of their quality and appeal; they tend to become rarer over time due to misuse or simple decay, meaning they’ll always have value.\\u200d14. Tarot Card ReadingTarot Card readings are great for entrepreneurs looking for some insight into their business and future. If you can’t afford a $200-an-hour coach, you can use a free deck of tarot cards. To keep things simple, go with three cards (past, present and future) or pick one major problem in your life and interpret every card around it. \\u200dDraw one card a day—for example, draw a card on Monday and interpret its meaning for that day only; then, draw another on Tuesday, interpret it Tuesday’s significance; Wednesday’s etc. When you run out of cards (or get stuck), start again from the beginning. \\u200d15. T-shirt BusinessIf you’re handy with a sewing machine and can prepare to have some artistic talent, then you might be able to start your own business making custom T-shirts and selling them online. Use your creativity to design a variety of interesting, eye-catching T-shirt designs that will get people’s attention and ensure them express their personality or stand out from their limited space. \\xa0\\u200dYou can also do similar things by creating cool wall art or simple decorative signs for companies or events (with enough luck, you could even start something like Friskis & Svettis—Plus, fun fact: we assure them). T-shirts are an affordable product that anyone can make and sell; there\\'s no bulk manufacturing involved at any point so it doesn\\'t cost thousands of dollars upfront.\\u200d\\n\\n\\n\\n!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);\\n\\n    ._600px {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  max-width: 700px;\\n  margin: 0px auto;\\n  padding: 16px 55px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: justify;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: justify;\\n  justify-content: space-between;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border: 1px solid #2e31be;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n}\\n\\n.get-demo-buttom {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 60px;\\n  max-width: 45%;\\n  padding-right: 28px;\\n  padding-left: 28px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n  background-color: #2e31be;\\n  font-size: 18px;\\n  font-weight: 700;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  text-decoration: none;\\n  color: #fff;\\n  white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n.button-inverse {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 60px;\\n  max-width: 45%;\\n  padding-right: 28px;\\n  padding-left: 28px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border: 1px solid #2e31be;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n  background-color: #fff;\\n  color: #2e31be;\\n  font-size: 18px;\\n  font-weight: 700;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  text-decoration: none;\\n white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {\\n  ._600px {\\n    padding: 20px 16px;\\n    \\n  }\\n\\n  .get-demo-buttom {\\n    height: 48px;\\n    max-width: 48%;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    white-space: nowrap;\\n    \\n  }\\n\\n  .button-inverse {\\n    height: 48px;\\n    max-width: 48%;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    white-space: nowrap;\\n  }\\n}\\n  \\n\\nGet Demo\\nStart for Free\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200d16. Party PlannerAre you always being asked by friends or family members to plan events for them? You might be a natural party planner! Just think of all those large birthday parties, weddings, or other social gatherings. As a party planner, you’ll be responsible for coordinating every aspect of events—from booking venues and securing catering services, to choosing decor and flowers. \\u200dWhen it comes down to it, your role is to facilitate people having a good time! From start to finish you’ll be working with clients and figuring out what their needs are, but more than anything else, being successful as a party. Planner depends on your ability to understand different personalities and work with different groups of people. Party planning can be fun and lucrative if you have what it takes!\\u200d17. Digital Marketing AgencyWith an established internet and mobile phone user base, you have more potential customers at your fingertips than ever before. Digital marketing agencies are popping up all over India and tapping into local networks is one of their biggest sources of new business. \\xa0If you want to stay relevant and connect with as many people as possible, it makes sense to take advantage of digital marketing techniques yourself.\\u200dYou don’t need a big budget or expertise; if you can read and write English well enough to understand how search engines work, then you can set up a small website or landing page that advertises your services or product offerings.\\u200d18. Rural Handicrafts ShopSetting up a rural handicrafts shop could be a successful small business idea. It could be quite lucrative—the global craft market is worth around $80 billion. Often passed down from generation to generation, these one-of-a-kind pieces sell for a premium and are often made with natural materials such as wood, clay, straw and bone. \\xa0\\u200dThink about creating your unique craft using local materials—something that can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars at first but will cost you just pennies (or even nothing) to make!\\u200d19. Wedding PlannerWeddings are big business; there’s no denying that. In 2017, American couples spent an average of $26,444 on their wedding day, according to Wedding Wire. If you have a knack for organization and a love of all things design-related, becoming a wedding planner could be a great way to combine your interests and start your own business. \\u200d20. Fitness TrainerAs more and more people become health-conscious, a growing number of folks are looking for an easy way to get into shape. If you have some experience with exercise, consider becoming a fitness trainer. You can start by working out of your own home (or personal gym) and offering clients advice via Skype or one-on-one sessions. \\u200dIf you’re ambitious, make it official by becoming certified through organizations like ACE or NSCA so that you can get insurance and open up your business entirely. Do be aware that as your client base grows, so will your responsibilities (licensing requirements, etc.), so keep that in mind when considering whether it’s right for you. \\u200d21. Manufacturing & Industrial GoodsIf you’re hoping to start a small business that caters primarily to other businesses, then look no further than manufacturing and industrial goods. Manufacturing is one of the oldest forms of entrepreneurship, with many craftsmen and artisans working independently from their homes. This form of work is anything but easy though. If you want to succeed at selling high-quality goods or services directly to businesses, then be prepared for years of hard work and long hours. \\xa0\\u200dHigh school education isn’t enough for most careers in manufacturing; most require post-secondary training or an apprenticeship with a mentor in your chosen field. Some entry-level manufacturing jobs do exist though so don’t give up on your dream if you only have a high school diploma\\u200d22. Spoken English ClassesIndia has a booming population of English speakers and it is only growing as more and more people become educated. By starting Spoken English classes, you can help those who wish to improve their communication skills by teaching them how to speak fluent English. \\u200dIt is also one of those skills that can be used anywhere on earth because everyone everywhere speaks English. Also, there are already several institutions popping up all over India. If you have an interest in it, now is a great time to start building your business model and marketing strategy.\\u200d\\u200d23. Handmade Soap BusinessTo start a handmade soap business, you’ll first need to acquire soapmaking skills. You can either learn these skills on your own or hire a soapmaking expert. Once you have them, develop an online presence and start marketing your homemade soaps. If you want, you can also expand by adding fragrances, gifts, or kits for different occasions (such as baby showers). \\xa0\\u200dBy learning more about soap making and marketing it online through blogs or social media accounts, it’s possible to make over $1 million a year selling homemade soap. Average annual pay: $100,000.\\u200d24. Retail TradeWhile a lot of businesses require capital or large amounts of space, retail trade is one of India’s most common small business ideas. If you are planning to open a retail shop in Bihar (Patna), make sure that your target market is clear and that you have thoroughly researched their needs. \\u200dWhether you plan on opening a clothing boutique, supermarket, bakery or grocery store—you should have realistic projections for your income and expenses at every stage before launching your business. It might be an idea to start with a trial run before fully investing so that if something doesn’t work out as planned you don’t lose too much money.\\u200d25. Co-working SpaceDid you know that as many as 50% of new businesses started after 2017 were started by freelancers? It’s a statistic that should excite entrepreneurs who are looking to start a business. Co-working spaces have become increasingly popular and they give freelancers an environment where they can work remotely, meet with clients, or collaborate with other like-minded entrepreneurs on their terms. \\u200dAnd since co-working spaces aren’t exclusively for startups and freelancers, you could even use one as an incubator or jumping-off point for your bigger goals. \\u200d26. Share TradingOwning a share or two could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to your retirement savings and entitle you to significant tax breaks. If you\\'re smart about it, trading can be extremely lucrative. To get started, open an online share trading account with a reputable stockbroker and research companies with low-priced shares that have the potential for future growth. \\xa0\\u200dThis is a long-term game so make sure your stockbrokers can hold shares without their value dipping below what you paid for them while allowing you time off if things go south. For example, NSE is the biggest stock market in which most people invest.\\u200d27. Organic FarmingThis segment is also known as biological farming or ecological farming. In India, farmers are encouraged by the Government of India and government bodies like the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to adopt organic methods of cultivation. \\u200dDifferent states of India encourage a different types of organic farming depending on soil fertility and climatic conditions. The western states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab have been experimenting with raised bed gardening while Andhra Pradesh has come up with a revolutionary method called System of Rice Intensification (SRI). Both these methods aim at intensifying production while minimising the use of external inputs.\\u200d28. Homemade ChocolatesWhether you\\'re looking for a new way to spend quality time with your kids or want a unique gift for friends and family, making chocolate at home can be as easy as 1-2-3. The process of creating homemade chocolates is quite simple. \\u200dMost recipes call for four ingredients: Cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, sugar and vanilla extract. By using just these ingredients, you can make truffles, bars or even hot cocoa. \\xa0Be sure to do plenty of research before trying out any recipe; many chefs have been known to get creative when it comes to their secret recipes!\\u200d29. Toy ShopSince most toys are impulse buys, toy shops are great places for entrepreneurs who want to build a business around something they\\'re passionate about. Sell collectable figurines, popular action figures and stuffed animals, or start a shop that sells high-quality puzzles and games. Provide information on age recommendations, or conduct classes on how to play these games. \\xa0\\u200dPair your shop with a website that lists all of your products and provides reviews by customers who have purchased them. For example, there is Hamleys, it\\'s known for the best toy business in the India you can research it and can plan accordingly\\u200d\\n\\n\\n\\n!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);\\n\\n    ._600px {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  max-width: 700px;\\n  margin: 0px auto;\\n  padding: 16px 55px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: justify;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: justify;\\n  justify-content: space-between;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border: 1px solid #2e31be;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n}\\n\\n.get-demo-buttom {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 60px;\\n  max-width: 45%;\\n  padding-right: 28px;\\n  padding-left: 28px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n  background-color: #2e31be;\\n  font-size: 18px;\\n  font-weight: 700;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  text-decoration: none;\\n  color: #fff;\\n  white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n.button-inverse {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 60px;\\n  max-width: 45%;\\n  padding-right: 28px;\\n  padding-left: 28px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border: 1px solid #2e31be;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n  background-color: #fff;\\n  color: #2e31be;\\n  font-size: 18px;\\n  font-weight: 700;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  text-decoration: none;\\n white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {\\n  ._600px {\\n    padding: 20px 16px;\\n    \\n  }\\n\\n  .get-demo-buttom {\\n    height: 48px;\\n    max-width: 48%;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    white-space: nowrap;\\n    \\n  }\\n\\n  .button-inverse {\\n    height: 48px;\\n    max-width: 48%;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    white-space: nowrap;\\n  }\\n}\\n  \\n\\nGet Demo\\nStart for Free\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200d30. Travel AgentIf you’re on good terms with your family and friends, it’s easy to stay connected. Why not put that skill to use as a travel agent? Put together packages for friends, co-workers, or clients who want a special trip but don’t know where they want to go. Book travel plans and tours when they need them and show them how travelling is more fun when it’s shared with those you love. \\u200dYou can be an independent contractor for an agency or reach out directly to people through your business website. Either way, it makes sense financially if you’re able to build up at least 25 regular clients. Some agencies might even allow you to take on some of their high-profile clients, who typically book well in advance.\\u200d31. Home-cooked SnacksReady-to-eat snacks can get expensive, but you can make your snacks at home for way less money. Your favourites (chips, pretzels, popcorn) are easy enough, but why not try some new foods? Here are a few suggestions: Sprinkle a handful of cheese and dehydrated vegetables on top of sliced fruit like mango or papaya. Then heat it by popping it into your toaster oven. \\u200dAt home, buy packages of bacon and cook them in a pan until they\\'re crispy; let cool and eat as is or crumble over salads. You could also keep cooked bacon chilled and ready for snacking all week long using an ice cube tray. Boil an egg or two each Sunday afternoon and take out one per day during the week.\\u200d32. FreelancerPart-time freelance work is an excellent way for young entrepreneurs to start making a living from their ideas. But what if you want your small business idea (or your side hustle) to be more than just a job? For that, you need an ambitious goal: turning it into a full-time gig within two years. \\u200dHere are some tips for how to do just that: Find out the service that you can be good at, estimate the costs and then start looking for the demand. Plan out the outreach and shine out with your execution skills.\\u200d33. Tiffin CentreThe Tiffin Centre for Entrepreneurs is a unique self-employment initiative supported by NITI Aayog, UNDP India and Tata Trusts. It empowers women who are economically and socially disadvantaged through vocational training that improves their employability. The project aims to create livelihood opportunities for more than 6,500 underprivileged women over three years. To start a business in Patna, you may want to visit here. \\u200d34. Electrician ServicesSmall business owners often overlook electrics, but electricians can help you improve your office comfort and productivity. However, don’t just bring any old electrician onto your property—choose a licensed professional who specializes in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) or electrical work. \\u200dYou should also consider hiring a company that can provide all of your HVAC/electrical needs so that you get one-stop shopping for all of your office comfort needs. The same goes for other services, such as plumbing or IT support.\\u200d35. Photo BusinessIf you love taking pictures or want to get involved with fashion, creating a photography business is a great way to start your own business on a shoestring budget. Offer your services locally, via sites like Fiverr and Freelancer, or build up your portfolio by entering photography contests on platforms like Instagram and 500px. \\u200d36. Mobile Garage ServiceIf you have decent mechanical know-how and are looking for a business that has steady and predictable cash flow, owning a mobile auto service may be perfect for you. Mobile garages help people out when they get into car trouble by providing repair services at their location. \\u200dIf you don’t have space for a garage but still want to get into auto repair, consider becoming an apprentice at one of these shops or starting your own business as an independent contractor. \\u200d37. Candle-makingIf you’re crafty and have a flair for design, try making candles. It\\'s a simple process that requires little more than wax, wicks, dye, glass containers, and matches. Learn how-to candle-making online at sites like YouTube and Etsy, then start experimenting with different scents. \\u200dVoilà! A homemade product (and possibly side hustle) that can bring in extra money if you begin selling it around town or on websites like Etsy. \\xa0Keep reading about how to be successful as an entrepreneur in India.\\u200d38. Home BakerWant to get into the food business? Why not start by selling your baked goods at local farmer’s markets and craft fairs. Here are some tips for starting a home-based baking business. You\\'ll need start-up costs of $1,500, some easy-to-find equipment like mixing bowls and cookie sheets, as well as culinary skills—and don\\'t forget about all those hungry customers! \\u200dSome of these businesses are just getting started so be sure to stay up-to-date on legal matters, such as sales tax laws. And keep in mind that you will likely want help from an accountant for everything from bookkeeping to filing taxes. Luckily there are plenty of online resources available for those just getting their small business ideas off of paper and into action.\\u200d\\u200d39. Web & App Developing ServiceWeb and App development is one great business idea. If you want to make money online, Web & app development is one way. We provide solutions for small businesses as well as large-scale business setups also. So, if you want to become a successful entrepreneur then it\\'s better to choose our services and see changes. Our Services Includes\\u200d40. Recruitment AgencyRecruitment agencies specialize in sourcing and hiring candidates for job openings. The work of a recruitment agency differs from an executive search firm because recruiters focus on finding employees for specific jobs, whereas headhunters try to fill entire leadership teams at once. \\u200dIf you’re looking for a new career opportunity, several startups can help, but it is important to find one that has appropriate licensing and accreditation. You can also consider launching your recruitment agency; while you will need to be licensed with relevant agencies like your state government, running such an agency takes little more than a few well-placed ads and some elbow grease (translation: clients). \\xa0\\u200dIt\\'s also worth noting that there are two types of recruiters - contingency recruiters and retainer recruiters.\\u200d41. Tax & Accounting ServiceIf you’re a do-it-yourself tax filer, why not make it easy on yourself? Hire a professional tax service and have peace of mind that your taxes are filed correctly. If you’re having trouble finding clients for your small business, think about signing up with an online aggregator, such as an accounting service or social media management company. \\u200dThis is also an opportunity to cross-sell additional services to your existing customers. Tax services can be surprisingly lucrative for self-employed individuals and pros often have more time on their hands than other professionals who charge by their hour.\\u200d42. Social Media InfluencerAnyone with a little bit of an online presence and a solid following is bound to be able to cash in on social media influence. There are all sorts of ways you can monetize your presence here, through branded content, affiliate marketing, social media optimization, and more. But don’t just take our word for it. \\xa0\\u200dResearch various agencies and determine which will best suit your goals (e.g., agency A specializes in branded content campaigns while agency B specializes in organic reach). Reach out and see how they can help you put your social media skills to work.\\u200d43. Drone Camera ServicesSince drones are getting so popular, you can buy a drone and start your own photography business. You can charge for wedding photos, and taking pictures of properties, scenery, and wildlife. Drones have quickly become one of the best ways to earn extra income from home. \\u200d44. Seasonal BusinessCreating a seasonal business is a great way to make money, but it’s also a ton of work. If you run, say, a Christmas tree lot, you can start that up right after New Year’s (maybe even opening early if there are some other Christmas tree lots on your street). Just be prepared for an influx of customers as soon as Halloween and Thanksgiving are over. \\xa0\\u200dOn one hand, that means more money. On the other hand, though: it will mean less time and less sleep because now you’re working through some of your busiest seasons.\\u200d45. Franchise for Popular BrandsFranchising is often a good way for aspiring entrepreneurs to get a business started with some backing. But it’s no guarantee of success—just ask any franchisee. Choose your franchisor carefully and understand what you’re getting into before making any decisions or writing any checks. \\u200dIf you plan on franchising, make sure you write a clear franchise disclosure document that lays out all details and fees involved. This will help ensure that both parties are operating from an informed position, helping avoid costly miscommunications down the road.\\u200d\\n\\n\\n\\n!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);\\n\\n    ._600px {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  max-width: 700px;\\n  margin: 0px auto;\\n  padding: 16px 55px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: justify;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: justify;\\n  justify-content: space-between;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border: 1px solid #2e31be;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n}\\n\\n.get-demo-buttom {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 60px;\\n  max-width: 45%;\\n  padding-right: 28px;\\n  padding-left: 28px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n  background-color: #2e31be;\\n  font-size: 18px;\\n  font-weight: 700;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  text-decoration: none;\\n  color: #fff;\\n  white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n.button-inverse {\\n  display: -webkit-box;\\n  display: -webkit-flex;\\n  display: -ms-flexbox;\\n  display: flex;\\n  width: 100%;\\n  height: 60px;\\n  max-width: 45%;\\n  padding-right: 28px;\\n  padding-left: 28px;\\n  -webkit-box-pack: center;\\n  -webkit-justify-content: center;\\n  -ms-flex-pack: center;\\n  justify-content: center;\\n  -webkit-box-align: center;\\n  -webkit-align-items: center;\\n  -ms-flex-align: center;\\n  align-items: center;\\n  border: 1px solid #2e31be;\\n  border-radius: 3px;\\n  background-color: #fff;\\n  color: #2e31be;\\n  font-size: 18px;\\n  font-weight: 700;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  text-decoration: none;\\n white-space: nowrap;\\n}\\n\\n@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {\\n  ._600px {\\n    padding: 20px 16px;\\n    \\n  }\\n\\n  .get-demo-buttom {\\n    height: 48px;\\n    max-width: 48%;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    white-space: nowrap;\\n    \\n  }\\n\\n  .button-inverse {\\n    height: 48px;\\n    max-width: 48%;\\n    font-size: 16px;\\n    white-space: nowrap;\\n  }\\n}\\n  \\n\\nGet Demo\\nStart for Free\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u200d46. DropshippingDo you have your own business? Not really. You have a shop window through which you can sell products or services, but do not have an inventory of those items or space for production. You drop ship these items from another source and thus, don’t hold any value. \\u200dSince there is no investment on your end, dropshipping is a great way to make money if you want to test out a product idea or market demand before going into heavy costs. One thing that’s worth noting here: It takes a lot of skill and hard work (or rather time) to find suppliers that will take on orders from individuals with no history as well as with no business credentials at all.\\u200d47. Aquariums And FishStarting an aquarium or fish farm is a fantastic business idea. You can either go for freshwater or saltwater aquariums. And you don’t even need much capital to start it. It is just like any other average shop; if your business grows big, you can also sell those fish online. \\u200d48. Online Shopping Store SectionsOnline shopping stores will be an integral part of your success, as customers will expect you to have them and come to you. There are two ways of looking at these and other such solutions; some look at the investment costs, while others look at long-term profits. \\u200dSome ask how long it will take them to break even, while others understand that revenue on day one is better than revenue on day five or ten.\\u200d49. Ice cubesHave you ever heard that everyone is getting out of hand in ice cubes? That’s because of their numerous health benefits. Ice cubes, made from melted water, have fewer calories and are more effective at keeping your foods and drinks relaxed than warmer alternatives like refrigerators or air conditioners. \\u200dIce cubes also come with many health benefits, as they can lower swelling caused by minor injuries and help soothe sore muscles after exercise.\\u200dConclusionDoing business is a dream for many and if you want to make your dream come true, start exploring our list of small business ideas. Don’t be afraid! Finding an idea is as simple as asking yourself what you like doing and how much time do you have?

This was our list of famous and successful startups and entrepreneurs from Patna(Bihar). \\u200dBusiness Ideas In PatnaHope this list will help you in having a business idea which you can start on your own.1. Insurance AgentsInsurance companies look for agents who have a proven track record of sales, customer service, and leadership. Most agents are self-employed, which means they earn 100% of their commissions. \\u200dIf you like working with people but don’t want to be a customer service representative, selling insurance might be a good option for you. To start your agency, you’ll need about $3,000 to get started; plan on staying at it for about three years before reaching breakeven. Then you can apply your earnings toward a new car or motorcycle! Or consider leasing out space in your office space so other agents can use it when your turn is over—just make sure that what you say about yourself is true!\\u200d2. Online Tuition ClassesAccording to Skill India’s survey report of 2015, online tutoring is one of the most promising new opportunities for entrepreneurship. If you’re good at explaining difficult concepts and have the ability for helping people learn, consider teaching math, science, English or any other subjects online. \\u200dSites like TutorVista or TutorChat let you sign up as a tutor and chat with potential students from around your city—the perfect way to bring extra income into your life while still working full-time.

Online MarketingIf you want your business to grow online, you need an established online presence. Online marketing is at its most basic when it comes to organic search. You want people looking for your products or services online, and then you want them to find your site first. \\u200dSearch engine optimization (SEO) is key here, and that’s a job for an expert—and while there are many good SEO firms out there (one of which we profile in Best Places to Work 2018), if you have a specific service or product that needs attention from a local perspective, it might be easier and more cost-effective for you to handle SEO yourself. Sure, SEO may take time, but if done correctly it can pay off immensely with higher rankings on Google and other search engines.\\u200d4. BabysittingThe best part about babysitting is that it’s an easy way to make some extra cash on nights and weekends while helping people out. Find a family who has young children, ask around for regular gigs, and spread your word through friends or social media. You can also create a Facebook group where parents can post babysitting jobs they need to be done. \\u200dJoin up with a few families and make it into a business! Once you get going, you could even offer paid services—I can vouch for how hard it is to find trustworthy babysitters in your area. (Maybe that\\'s why I haven\\'t hired one yet?) But if you build up enough trust with families, you could set yourself apart by adding new services like cleaning houses or doing grocery shopping on occasion.\\u200d5. Computer Software & HardwareThe demand for Computer Software and Hardware services is increasing every year. This is one of those businesses that you can start with a small investment, as long as you know where to find low-cost resources for your inventory. As your business grows, so will your need for employee assistance. Hiring full-time employees (instead of independent contractors) will help you build a stronger company—it can also help you save on taxes and avoid some insurance hassles. \\u200dYou must create a legal structure (either an LLC or a corporation) before bringing on any staff members—you don’t want anyone to have ownership rights over your business ideas or products! \\u200d6. Pet-sittingIn most big cities, people are very busy and simply don’t have time to take care of their pets. If you have some love for animals and extra time on your hands, pet-sitting could be a great way to make a little money in exchange for companionship. \\u200dAs long as you have room in your home for a few extra sets of paws, there are all sorts of online websites that can help connect you with local pet owners looking for overnight or full-time caretakers for their cats, dogs, turtles and more.\\u200d7. ConsultancyConsulting is one of those professions that has an oddly negative connotation. If a person isn’t quite sure what they want to do, consulting will always be there—but nobody ever wants to pursue it. This may be true, but anyone with a technical background can be an expert consultant if they want. Consulting simply means that you are being paid for your knowledge or services and not necessarily your ability to implement those things yourself. \\u200dYou could be making six figures as a consultant and working 20 hours per week with very little experience in a subject matter area you love! Want to start part-time? That’s possible too! There are tons of people who work freelance consulting jobs after school as well as professionals who have been doing it for years. \\u200d8. Pet GroomingAccording to some estimates, pet grooming is one of the fastest-growing industries for small businesses. If you’re a dog or cat lover and have an eye for detail, then starting your own pet grooming business might be a great idea for you. Pet owners from around your community are sure to line up when they hear how well you groom their furry friends. You can easily find advice on how to start a pet grooming business online. \\u200dHere\\'s a quick primer on getting started: Put together as much information about your pet-grooming services as possible—address any concerns potential customers may have and make it easy for them to contact you and set up an appointment. \\u200d9. Lamaze EducatorAs a child development major and former teacher, I’ve been around kids a lot. But it wasn’t until I became an educator for a well-known pregnancy brand that I was lucky enough to learn about all of the amazing benefits surrounding birth and babies. \\u200dThe more time I spent with families, newborns, and expecting parents, I saw firsthand how many opportunities there are for other people interested in working with babies — as doulas (birth coaches), maternity photographers, massage therapists or lactation consultants, just to name a few. If you have an interest or passion for being involved with expectant families during one of life’s most incredible moments, consider these small business ideas\\u200d10. Salon ServicesIf you have a talent for hair, nails, or makeup and think you’d be good at running a salon business from home, consider starting your own. Some services include haircuts, mani-pedis and waxing. \\u200dIn addition to those listed here, others might fit your talents such as braiding and facial massage. Of course, it helps if you already have an existing client; get creative with what services you can offer based on other interests and hobbies.\\u200d\\u200d11. Personalised GiftsBuyers love it when a company asks them questions about themselves.They’re more likely to purchase from that brand, and they’ll be happy to tell their friends about their experience. \\u200dThe key is making sure you ask your customers open-ended questions that will elicit more than one-word answers. Think of it as marketing research that also benefits your brand — and gives you new customers!\\u200d12. Organic and Natural CosmeticsBeauty trends are constantly evolving and you can capitalize on these changes by starting a company that sells organic and natural cosmetics. As people become more health conscious, they’re looking for products that are free of chemicals, preservatives, and artificial colours. This is an evergreen industry because it deals with basic human needs. \\u200dAdditionally, you have plenty of room to experiment with colour, scents, and packaging—there’s even demand designer lipsticks! \\xa0Think about what kinds of beauty products might be well-received among customers in your area (your local colleges or malls will give you some good hints). The possibilities are endless!\\u200d13. Antique BusinessIf you’re looking for something that gives a more defined return on investment, consider becoming an antique dealer. Starting an antique business isn’t as complex as it may seem—all you need is time and dedication. You’ll also need a good eye for spotting vintage items that people are ready to buy. According to CNN, starting your online antique store can earn you around $1,000 per month by leveraging current trends while still making sure you keep prices reasonable. \\xa0\\u200dWhatever your plan, working with old products will always be valuable because of their quality and appeal; they tend to become rarer over time due to misuse or simple decay, meaning they’ll always have value.\\u200d14. Tarot Card ReadingTarot Card readings are great for entrepreneurs looking for some insight into their business and future. If you can’t afford a $200-an-hour coach, you can use a free deck of tarot cards. To keep things simple, go with three cards (past, present and future) or pick one major problem in your life and interpret every card around it. \\u200dDraw one card a day—for example, draw a card on Monday and interpret its meaning for that day only; then, draw another on Tuesday, interpret it Tuesday’s significance; Wednesday’s etc. When you run out of cards (or get stuck), start again from the beginning. \\u200d15. T-shirt BusinessIf you’re handy with a sewing machine and can prepare to have some artistic talent, then you might be able to start your own business making custom T-shirts and selling them online. Use your creativity to design a variety of interesting, eye-catching T-shirt designs that will get people’s attention and ensure them express their personality or stand out from their limited space. \\xa0\\u200dYou can also do similar things by creating cool wall art or simple decorative signs for companies or events (with enough luck, you could even start something like Friskis & Svettis—Plus, fun fact: we assure them). T-shirts are an affordable product that anyone can make and sell; there\\'s no bulk manufacturing involved at any point so it doesn\\'t cost thousands of dollars upfront.\\u200d!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);    ._600px {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  max-width: 700px;  margin: 0px auto;  padding: 16px 55px;  -webkit-box-pack: justify;  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;  -ms-flex-pack: justify;  justify-content: space-between;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;}.get-demo-buttom {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none;  color: #fff;  white-space: nowrap;}.button-inverse {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #fff;  color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none; white-space: nowrap;}@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {  ._600px {    padding: 20px 16px;      }  .get-demo-buttom {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;      }  .button-inverse {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;  }}  Get DemoStart for Free\\u200d16. Party PlannerAre you always being asked by friends or family members to plan events for them? You might be a natural party planner! Just think of all those large birthday parties, weddings, or other social gatherings. As a party planner, you’ll be responsible for coordinating every aspect of events—from booking venues and securing catering services, to choosing decor and flowers. \\u200dWhen it comes down to it, your role is to facilitate people having a good time! From start to finish you’ll be working with clients and figuring out what their needs are, but more than anything else, being successful as a party. Planner depends on your ability to understand different personalities and work with different groups of people. Party planning can be fun and lucrative if you have what it takes!\\u200d17. Digital Marketing AgencyWith an established internet and mobile phone user base, you have more potential customers at your fingertips than ever before. Digital marketing agencies are popping up all over India and tapping into local networks is one of their biggest sources of new business. \\xa0If you want to stay relevant and connect with as many people as possible, it makes sense to take advantage of digital marketing techniques yourself.\\u200dYou don’t need a big budget or expertise; if you can read and write English well enough to understand how search engines work, then you can set up a small website or landing page that advertises your services or product offerings.\\u200d18. Rural Handicrafts ShopSetting up a rural handicrafts shop could be a successful small business idea. It could be quite lucrative—the global craft market is worth around $80 billion. Often passed down from generation to generation, these one-of-a-kind pieces sell for a premium and are often made with natural materials such as wood, clay, straw and bone. \\xa0\\u200dThink about creating your unique craft using local materials—something that can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars at first but will cost you just pennies (or even nothing) to make!\\u200d19. Wedding PlannerWeddings are big business; there’s no denying that. In 2017, American couples spent an average of $26,444 on their wedding day, according to Wedding Wire. If you have a knack for organization and a love of all things design-related, becoming a wedding planner could be a great way to combine your interests and start your own business. \\u200d20. Fitness TrainerAs more and more people become health-conscious, a growing number of folks are looking for an easy way to get into shape. If you have some experience with exercise, consider becoming a fitness trainer. You can start by working out of your own home (or personal gym) and offering clients advice via Skype or one-on-one sessions. \\u200dIf you’re ambitious, make it official by becoming certified through organizations like ACE or NSCA so that you can get insurance and open up your business entirely. Do be aware that as your client base grows, so will your responsibilities (licensing requirements, etc.), so keep that in mind when considering whether it’s right for you. \\u200d21. Manufacturing & Industrial GoodsIf you’re hoping to start a small business that caters primarily to other businesses, then look no further than manufacturing and industrial goods. Manufacturing is one of the oldest forms of entrepreneurship, with many craftsmen and artisans working independently from their homes. This form of work is anything but easy though. If you want to succeed at selling high-quality goods or services directly to businesses, then be prepared for years of hard work and long hours. \\xa0\\u200dHigh school education isn’t enough for most careers in manufacturing; most require post-secondary training or an apprenticeship with a mentor in your chosen field. Some entry-level manufacturing jobs do exist though so don’t give up on your dream if you only have a high school diploma\\u200d22. Spoken English ClassesIndia has a booming population of English speakers and it is only growing as more and more people become educated. By starting Spoken English classes, you can help those who wish to improve their communication skills by teaching them how to speak fluent English. \\u200dIt is also one of those skills that can be used anywhere on earth because everyone everywhere speaks English. Also, there are already several institutions popping up all over India. If you have an interest in it, now is a great time to start building your business model and marketing strategy.\\u200d\\u200d23. Handmade Soap BusinessTo start a handmade soap business, you’ll first need to acquire soapmaking skills. You can either learn these skills on your own or hire a soapmaking expert. Once you have them, develop an online presence and start marketing your homemade soaps. If you want, you can also expand by adding fragrances, gifts, or kits for different occasions (such as baby showers). \\xa0\\u200dBy learning more about soap making and marketing it online through blogs or social media accounts, it’s possible to make over $1 million a year selling homemade soap. Average annual pay: $100,000.\\u200d24. Retail TradeWhile a lot of businesses require capital or large amounts of space, retail trade is one of India’s most common small business ideas. If you are planning to open a retail shop in Bihar (Patna), make sure that your target market is clear and that you have thoroughly researched their needs. \\u200dWhether you plan on opening a clothing boutique, supermarket, bakery or grocery store—you should have realistic projections for your income and expenses at every stage before launching your business. It might be an idea to start with a trial run before fully investing so that if something doesn’t work out as planned you don’t lose too much money.\\u200d25. Co-working SpaceDid you know that as many as 50% of new businesses started after 2017 were started by freelancers? It’s a statistic that should excite entrepreneurs who are looking to start a business. Co-working spaces have become increasingly popular and they give freelancers an environment where they can work remotely, meet with clients, or collaborate with other like-minded entrepreneurs on their terms. \\u200dAnd since co-working spaces aren’t exclusively for startups and freelancers, you could even use one as an incubator or jumping-off point for your bigger goals. \\u200d26. Share TradingOwning a share or two could add hundreds of thousands of dollars to your retirement savings and entitle you to significant tax breaks. If you\\'re smart about it, trading can be extremely lucrative. To get started, open an online share trading account with a reputable stockbroker and research companies with low-priced shares that have the potential for future growth. \\xa0\\u200dThis is a long-term game so make sure your stockbrokers can hold shares without their value dipping below what you paid for them while allowing you time off if things go south. For example, NSE is the biggest stock market in which most people invest.\\u200d27. Organic FarmingThis segment is also known as biological farming or ecological farming. In India, farmers are encouraged by the Government of India and government bodies like the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to adopt organic methods of cultivation. \\u200dDifferent states of India encourage a different types of organic farming depending on soil fertility and climatic conditions. The western states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab have been experimenting with raised bed gardening while Andhra Pradesh has come up with a revolutionary method called System of Rice Intensification (SRI). Both these methods aim at intensifying production while minimising the use of external inputs.\\u200d28. Homemade ChocolatesWhether you\\'re looking for a new way to spend quality time with your kids or want a unique gift for friends and family, making chocolate at home can be as easy as 1-2-3. The process of creating homemade chocolates is quite simple. \\u200dMost recipes call for four ingredients: Cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, sugar and vanilla extract. By using just these ingredients, you can make truffles, bars or even hot cocoa. \\xa0Be sure to do plenty of research before trying out any recipe; many chefs have been known to get creative when it comes to their secret recipes!\\u200d29. Toy ShopSince most toys are impulse buys, toy shops are great places for entrepreneurs who want to build a business around something they\\'re passionate about.

Travel AgentIf you’re on good terms with your family and friends, it’s easy to stay connected. Why not put that skill to use as a travel agent? Put together packages for friends, co-workers, or clients who want a special trip but don’t know where they want to go. Book travel plans and tours when they need them and show them how travelling is more fun when it’s shared with those you love. \\u200dYou can be an independent contractor for an agency or reach out directly to people through your business website. Either way, it makes sense financially if you’re able to build up at least 25 regular clients. Some agencies might even allow you to take on some of their high-profile clients, who typically book well in advance.\\u200d31. Home-cooked SnacksReady-to-eat snacks can get expensive, but you can make your snacks at home for way less money. Your favourites (chips, pretzels, popcorn) are easy enough, but why not try some new foods? Here are a few suggestions: Sprinkle a handful of cheese and dehydrated vegetables on top of sliced fruit like mango or papaya. Then heat it by popping it into your toaster oven. \\u200dAt home, buy packages of bacon and cook them in a pan until they\\'re crispy; let cool and eat as is or crumble over salads. You could also keep cooked bacon chilled and ready for snacking all week long using an ice cube tray. Boil an egg or two each Sunday afternoon and take out one per day during the week.\\u200d32. FreelancerPart-time freelance work is an excellent way for young entrepreneurs to start making a living from their ideas. But what if you want your small business idea (or your side hustle) to be more than just a job? For that, you need an ambitious goal: turning it into a full-time gig within two years. \\u200dHere are some tips for how to do just that: Find out the service that you can be good at, estimate the costs and then start looking for the demand. Plan out the outreach and shine out with your execution skills.\\u200d33. Tiffin CentreThe Tiffin Centre for Entrepreneurs is a unique self-employment initiative supported by NITI Aayog, UNDP India and Tata Trusts. It empowers women who are economically and socially disadvantaged through vocational training that improves their employability. The project aims to create livelihood opportunities for more than 6,500 underprivileged women over three years. To start a business in Patna, you may want to visit here. \\u200d34. Electrician ServicesSmall business owners often overlook electrics, but electricians can help you improve your office comfort and productivity. However, don’t just bring any old electrician onto your property—choose a licensed professional who specializes in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) or electrical work. \\u200dYou should also consider hiring a company that can provide all of your HVAC/electrical needs so that you get one-stop shopping for all of your office comfort needs. The same goes for other services, such as plumbing or IT support.\\u200d35. Photo BusinessIf you love taking pictures or want to get involved with fashion, creating a photography business is a great way to start your own business on a shoestring budget. Offer your services locally, via sites like Fiverr and Freelancer, or build up your portfolio by entering photography contests on platforms like Instagram and 500px. \\u200d36. Mobile Garage ServiceIf you have decent mechanical know-how and are looking for a business that has steady and predictable cash flow, owning a mobile auto service may be perfect for you. Mobile garages help people out when they get into car trouble by providing repair services at their location. \\u200dIf you don’t have space for a garage but still want to get into auto repair, consider becoming an apprentice at one of these shops or starting your own business as an independent contractor. \\u200d37. Candle-makingIf you’re crafty and have a flair for design, try making candles. It\\'s a simple process that requires little more than wax, wicks, dye, glass containers, and matches. Learn how-to candle-making online at sites like YouTube and Etsy, then start experimenting with different scents. \\u200dVoilà! A homemade product (and possibly side hustle) that can bring in extra money if you begin selling it around town or on websites like Etsy. \\xa0Keep reading about how to be successful as an entrepreneur in India.\\u200d38. Home BakerWant to get into the food business? Why not start by selling your baked goods at local farmer’s markets and craft fairs. Here are some tips for starting a home-based baking business. You\\'ll need start-up costs of $1,500, some easy-to-find equipment like mixing bowls and cookie sheets, as well as culinary skills—and don\\'t forget about all those hungry customers! \\u200dSome of these businesses are just getting started so be sure to stay up-to-date on legal matters, such as sales tax laws. And keep in mind that you will likely want help from an accountant for everything from bookkeeping to filing taxes. Luckily there are plenty of online resources available for those just getting their small business ideas off of paper and into action.\\u200d\\u200d39. Web & App Developing ServiceWeb and App development is one great business idea. If you want to make money online, Web & app development is one way. We provide solutions for small businesses as well as large-scale business setups also. So, if you want to become a successful entrepreneur then it\\'s better to choose our services and see changes. Our Services Includes\\u200d40. Recruitment AgencyRecruitment agencies specialize in sourcing and hiring candidates for job openings. The work of a recruitment agency differs from an executive search firm because recruiters focus on finding employees for specific jobs, whereas headhunters try to fill entire leadership teams at once. \\u200dIf you’re looking for a new career opportunity, several startups can help, but it is important to find one that has appropriate licensing and accreditation. You can also consider launching your recruitment agency; while you will need to be licensed with relevant agencies like your state government, running such an agency takes little more than a few well-placed ads and some elbow grease (translation: clients). \\xa0\\u200dIt\\'s also worth noting that there are two types of recruiters - contingency recruiters and retainer recruiters.\\u200d41. Tax & Accounting ServiceIf you’re a do-it-yourself tax filer, why not make it easy on yourself? Hire a professional tax service and have peace of mind that your taxes are filed correctly. If you’re having trouble finding clients for your small business, think about signing up with an online aggregator, such as an accounting service or social media management company. \\u200dThis is also an opportunity to cross-sell additional services to your existing customers. Tax services can be surprisingly lucrative for self-employed individuals and pros often have more time on their hands than other professionals who charge by their hour.\\u200d42. Social Media InfluencerAnyone with a little bit of an online presence and a solid following is bound to be able to cash in on social media influence. There are all sorts of ways you can monetize your presence here, through branded content, affiliate marketing, social media optimization, and more. But don’t just take our word for it. \\xa0\\u200dResearch various agencies and determine which will best suit your goals (e.g., agency A specializes in branded content campaigns while agency B specializes in organic reach). Reach out and see how they can help you put your social media skills to work.\\u200d43. Drone Camera ServicesSince drones are getting so popular, you can buy a drone and start your own photography business. You can charge for wedding photos, and taking pictures of properties, scenery, and wildlife. Drones have quickly become one of the best ways to earn extra income from home. \\u200d44. Seasonal BusinessCreating a seasonal business is a great way to make money, but it’s also a ton of work. If you run, say, a Christmas tree lot, you can start that up right after New Year’s (maybe even opening early if there are some other Christmas tree lots on your street). Just be prepared for an influx of customers as soon as Halloween and Thanksgiving are over. \\xa0\\u200dOn one hand, that means more money. On the other hand, though: it will mean less time and less sleep because now you’re working through some of your busiest seasons.\\u200d45. Franchise for Popular BrandsFranchising is often a good way for aspiring entrepreneurs to get a business started with some backing. But it’s no guarantee of success—just ask any franchisee. Choose your franchisor carefully and understand what you’re getting into before making any decisions or writing any checks. \\u200dIf you plan on franchising, make sure you write a clear franchise disclosure document that lays out all details and fees involved. This will help ensure that both parties are operating from an informed position, helping avoid costly miscommunications down the road.\\u200d!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);    ._600px {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  max-width: 700px;  margin: 0px auto;  padding: 16px 55px;  -webkit-box-pack: justify;  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;  -ms-flex-pack: justify;  justify-content: space-between;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;}.get-demo-buttom {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none;  color: #fff;  white-space: nowrap;}.button-inverse {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #fff;  color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none; white-space: nowrap;}@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {  ._600px {    padding: 20px 16px;      }  .get-demo-buttom {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;      }  .button-inverse {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;  }}  Get DemoStart for Free\\u200d46. DropshippingDo you have your own business? Not really. You have a shop window through which you can sell products or services, but do not have an inventory of those items or space for production. You drop ship these items from another source and thus, don’t hold any value. \\u200dSince there is no investment on your end, dropshipping is a great way to make money if you want to test out a product idea or market demand before going into heavy costs. One thing that’s worth noting here: It takes a lot of skill and hard work (or rather time) to find suppliers that will take on orders from individuals with no history as well as with no business credentials at all.\\u200d47. Aquariums And FishStarting an aquarium or fish farm is a fantastic business idea. You can either go for freshwater or saltwater aquariums. And you don’t even need much capital to start it. It is just like any other average shop; if your business grows big, you can also sell those fish online. \\u200d48. Online Shopping Store SectionsOnline shopping stores will be an integral part of your success, as customers will expect you to have them and come to you. There are two ways of looking at these and other such solutions; some look at the investment costs, while others look at long-term profits. \\u200dSome ask how long it will take them to break even, while others understand that revenue on day one is better than revenue on day five or ten.\\u200d49. Ice cubesHave you ever heard that everyone is getting out of hand in ice cubes? That’s because of their numerous health benefits. Ice cubes, made from melted water, have fewer calories and are more effective at keeping your foods and drinks relaxed than warmer alternatives like refrigerators or air conditioners. \\u200dIce cubes also come with many health benefits, as they can lower swelling caused by minor injuries and help soothe sore muscles after exercise.\\u200dConclusionDoing business is a dream for many and if you want to make your dream come true, start exploring our list of small business ideas. Don’t be afraid! Finding an idea is as simple as asking yourself what you like doing and how much time do you have?

Insurance AgentsInsurance companies look for agents who have a proven track record of sales, customer service, and leadership. Most agents are self-employed, which means they earn 100% of their commissions. \\u200dIf you like working with people but don’t want to be a customer service representative, selling insurance might be a good option for you. To start your agency, you’ll need about $3,000 to get started; plan on staying at it for about three years before reaching breakeven. Then you can apply your earnings toward a new car or motorcycle! Or consider leasing out space in your office space so other agents can use it when your turn is over—just make sure that what you say about yourself is true!\\u200d2. Online Tuition ClassesAccording to Skill India’s survey report of 2015, online tutoring is one of the most promising new opportunities for entrepreneurship.

Online MarketingIf you want your business to grow online, you need an established online presence. Online marketing is at its most basic when it comes to organic search. You want people looking for your products or services online, and then you want them to find your site first. \\u200dSearch engine optimization (SEO) is key here, and that’s a job for an expert—and while there are many good SEO firms out there (one of which we profile in Best Places to Work 2018), if you have a specific service or product that needs attention from a local perspective, it might be easier and more cost-effective for you to handle SEO yourself. Sure, SEO may take time, but if done correctly it can pay off immensely with higher rankings on Google and other search engines.\\u200d4. BabysittingThe best part about babysitting is that it’s an easy way to make some extra cash on nights and weekends while helping people out. Find a family who has young children, ask around for regular gigs, and spread your word through friends or social media. You can also create a Facebook group where parents can post babysitting jobs they need to be done. \\u200dJoin up with a few families and make it into a business! Once you get going, you could even offer paid services—I can vouch for how hard it is to find trustworthy babysitters in your area. (Maybe that\\'s why I haven\\'t hired one yet?) But if you build up enough trust with families, you could set yourself apart by adding new services like cleaning houses or doing grocery shopping on occasion.\\u200d5. Computer Software & HardwareThe demand for Computer Software and Hardware services is increasing every year. This is one of those businesses that you can start with a small investment, as long as you know where to find low-cost resources for your inventory. As your business grows, so will your need for employee assistance. Hiring full-time employees (instead of independent contractors) will help you build a stronger company—it can also help you save on taxes and avoid some insurance hassles. \\u200dYou must create a legal structure (either an LLC or a corporation) before bringing on any staff members—you don’t want anyone to have ownership rights over your business ideas or products! \\u200d6. Pet-sittingIn most big cities, people are very busy and simply don’t have time to take care of their pets. If you have some love for animals and extra time on your hands, pet-sitting could be a great way to make a little money in exchange for companionship. \\u200dAs long as you have room in your home for a few extra sets of paws, there are all sorts of online websites that can help connect you with local pet owners looking for overnight or full-time caretakers for their cats, dogs, turtles and more.\\u200d7. ConsultancyConsulting is one of those professions that has an oddly negative connotation. If a person isn’t quite sure what they want to do, consulting will always be there—but nobody ever wants to pursue it. This may be true, but anyone with a technical background can be an expert consultant if they want. Consulting simply means that you are being paid for your knowledge or services and not necessarily your ability to implement those things yourself. \\u200dYou could be making six figures as a consultant and working 20 hours per week with very little experience in a subject matter area you love! Want to start part-time? That’s possible too! There are tons of people who work freelance consulting jobs after school as well as professionals who have been doing it for years. \\u200d8. Pet GroomingAccording to some estimates, pet grooming is one of the fastest-growing industries for small businesses. If you’re a dog or cat lover and have an eye for detail, then starting your own pet grooming business might be a great idea for you. Pet owners from around your community are sure to line up when they hear how well you groom their furry friends. You can easily find advice on how to start a pet grooming business online. \\u200dHere\\'s a quick primer on getting started: Put together as much information about your pet-grooming services as possible—address any concerns potential customers may have and make it easy for them to contact you and set up an appointment. \\u200d9. Lamaze EducatorAs a child development major and former teacher, I’ve been around kids a lot. But it wasn’t until I became an educator for a well-known pregnancy brand that I was lucky enough to learn about all of the amazing benefits surrounding birth and babies. \\u200dThe more time I spent with families, newborns, and expecting parents, I saw firsthand how many opportunities there are for other people interested in working with babies — as doulas (birth coaches), maternity photographers, massage therapists or lactation consultants, just to name a few. If you have an interest or passion for being involved with expectant families during one of life’s most incredible moments, consider these small business ideas\\u200d10. Salon ServicesIf you have a talent for hair, nails, or makeup and think you’d be good at running a salon business from home, consider starting your own. Some services include haircuts, mani-pedis and waxing. \\u200dIn addition to those listed here, others might fit your talents such as braiding and facial massage. Of course, it helps if you already have an existing client; get creative with what services you can offer based on other interests and hobbies.\\u200d\\u200d11. Personalised GiftsBuyers love it when a company asks them questions about themselves.They’re more likely to purchase from that brand, and they’ll be happy to tell their friends about their experience. \\u200dThe key is making sure you ask your customers open-ended questions that will elicit more than one-word answers. Think of it as marketing research that also benefits your brand — and gives you new customers!\\u200d12. Organic and Natural CosmeticsBeauty trends are constantly evolving and you can capitalize on these changes by starting a company that sells organic and natural cosmetics. As people become more health conscious, they’re looking for products that are free of chemicals, preservatives, and artificial colours. This is an evergreen industry because it deals with basic human needs. \\u200dAdditionally, you have plenty of room to experiment with colour, scents, and packaging—there’s even demand designer lipsticks! \\xa0Think about what kinds of beauty products might be well-received among customers in your area (your local colleges or malls will give you some good hints). The possibilities are endless!\\u200d13. Antique BusinessIf you’re looking for something that gives a more defined return on investment, consider becoming an antique dealer. Starting an antique business isn’t as complex as it may seem—all you need is time and dedication. You’ll also need a good eye for spotting vintage items that people are ready to buy. According to CNN, starting your online antique store can earn you around $1,000 per month by leveraging current trends while still making sure you keep prices reasonable. \\xa0\\u200dWhatever your plan, working with old products will always be valuable because of their quality and appeal; they tend to become rarer over time due to misuse or simple decay, meaning they’ll always have value.\\u200d14. Tarot Card ReadingTarot Card readings are great for entrepreneurs looking for some insight into their business and future. If you can’t afford a $200-an-hour coach, you can use a free deck of tarot cards. To keep things simple, go with three cards (past, present and future) or pick one major problem in your life and interpret every card around it. \\u200dDraw one card a day—for example, draw a card on Monday and interpret its meaning for that day only; then, draw another on Tuesday, interpret it Tuesday’s significance; Wednesday’s etc. When you run out of cards (or get stuck), start again from the beginning. \\u200d15. T-shirt BusinessIf you’re handy with a sewing machine and can prepare to have some artistic talent, then you might be able to start your own business making custom T-shirts and selling them online. Use your creativity to design a variety of interesting, eye-catching T-shirt designs that will get people’s attention and ensure them express their personality or stand out from their limited space. \\xa0\\u200dYou can also do similar things by creating cool wall art or simple decorative signs for companies or events (with enough luck, you could even start something like Friskis & Svettis—Plus, fun fact: we assure them). T-shirts are an affordable product that anyone can make and sell; there\\'s no bulk manufacturing involved at any point so it doesn\\'t cost thousands of dollars upfront.\\u200d!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);    ._600px {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  max-width: 700px;  margin: 0px auto;  padding: 16px 55px;  -webkit-box-pack: justify;  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;  -ms-flex-pack: justify;  justify-content: space-between;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;}.get-demo-buttom {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none;  color: #fff;  white-space: nowrap;}.button-inverse {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #fff;  color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none; white-space: nowrap;}@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {  ._600px {    padding: 20px 16px;      }  .get-demo-buttom {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;      }  .button-inverse {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;  }}  Get DemoStart for Free\\u200d16. Party PlannerAre you always being asked by friends or family members to plan events for them? You might be a natural party planner! Just think of all those large birthday parties, weddings, or other social gatherings. As a party planner, you’ll be responsible for coordinating every aspect of events—from booking venues and securing catering services, to choosing decor and flowers. \\u200dWhen it comes down to it, your role is to facilitate people having a good time! From start to finish you’ll be working with clients and figuring out what their needs are, but more than anything else, being successful as a party. Planner depends on your ability to understand different personalities and work with different groups of people. Party planning can be fun and lucrative if you have what it takes!\\u200d17. Digital Marketing AgencyWith an established internet and mobile phone user base, you have more potential customers at your fingertips than ever before. Digital marketing agencies are popping up all over India and tapping into local networks is one of their biggest sources of new business. \\xa0If you want to stay relevant and connect with as many people as possible, it makes sense to take advantage of digital marketing techniques yourself.\\u200dYou don’t need a big budget or expertise; if you can read and write English well enough to understand how search engines work, then you can set up a small website or landing page that advertises your services or product offerings.\\u200d18. Rural Handicrafts ShopSetting up a rural handicrafts shop could be a successful small business idea. It could be quite lucrative—the global craft market is worth around $80 billion. Often passed down from generation to generation, these one-of-a-kind pieces sell for a premium and are often made with natural materials such as wood, clay, straw and bone. \\xa0\\u200dThink about creating your unique craft using local materials—something that can sell for hundreds or even thousands of dollars at first but will cost you just pennies (or even nothing) to make!\\u200d19. Wedding PlannerWeddings are big business; there’s no denying that. In 2017, American couples spent an average of $26,444 on their wedding day, according to Wedding Wire.

Manufacturing & Industrial GoodsIf you’re hoping to start a small business that caters primarily to other businesses, then look no further than manufacturing and industrial goods. Manufacturing is one of the oldest forms of entrepreneurship, with many craftsmen and artisans working independently from their homes. This form of work is anything but easy though. If you want to succeed at selling high-quality goods or services directly to businesses, then be prepared for years of hard work and long hours. \\xa0\\u200dHigh school education isn’t enough for most careers in manufacturing; most require post-secondary training or an apprenticeship with a mentor in your chosen field. Some entry-level manufacturing jobs do exist though so don’t give up on your dream if you only have a high school diploma\\u200d22. Spoken English ClassesIndia has a booming population of English speakers and it is only growing as more and more people become educated.

If you are planning to open a retail shop in Bihar (Patna), make sure that your target market is clear and that you have thoroughly researched their needs. \\u200dWhether you plan on opening a clothing boutique, supermarket, bakery or grocery store—you should have realistic projections for your income and expenses at every stage before launching your business. It might be an idea to start with a trial run before fully investing so that if something doesn’t work out as planned you don’t lose too much money.\\u200d25. Co-working SpaceDid you know that as many as 50% of new businesses started after 2017 were started by freelancers? It’s a statistic that should excite entrepreneurs who are looking to start a business. Co-working spaces have become increasingly popular and they give freelancers an environment where they can work remotely, meet with clients, or collaborate with other like-minded entrepreneurs on their terms. \\u200dAnd since co-working spaces aren’t exclusively for startups and freelancers, you could even use one as an incubator or jumping-off point for your bigger goals. \\u200d26.

If you\\'re smart about it, trading can be extremely lucrative.

For example, NSE is the biggest stock market in which most people invest.\\u200d27. Organic FarmingThis segment is also known as biological farming or ecological farming. In India, farmers are encouraged by the Government of India and government bodies like the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to adopt organic methods of cultivation. \\u200dDifferent states of India encourage a different types of organic farming depending on soil fertility and climatic conditions. The western states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Haryana, Rajasthan and Punjab have been experimenting with raised bed gardening while Andhra Pradesh has come up with a revolutionary method called System of Rice Intensification (SRI). Both these methods aim at intensifying production while minimising the use of external inputs.\\u200d28. Homemade ChocolatesWhether you\\'re looking for a new way to spend quality time with your kids or want a unique gift for friends and family, making chocolate at home can be as easy as 1-2-3. The process of creating homemade chocolates is quite simple. \\u200dMost recipes call for four ingredients: Cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, sugar and vanilla extract. By using just these ingredients, you can make truffles, bars or even hot cocoa. \\xa0Be sure to do plenty of research before trying out any recipe; many chefs have been known to get creative when it comes to their secret recipes!\\u200d29.

Book travel plans and tours when they need them and show them how travelling is more fun when it’s shared with those you love. \\u200dYou can be an independent contractor for an agency or reach out directly to people through your business website. Either way, it makes sense financially if you’re able to build up at least 25 regular clients. Some agencies might even allow you to take on some of their high-profile clients, who typically book well in advance.\\u200d31. Home-cooked SnacksReady-to-eat snacks can get expensive, but you can make your snacks at home for way less money. Your favourites (chips, pretzels, popcorn) are easy enough, but why not try some new foods? Here are a few suggestions: Sprinkle a handful of cheese and dehydrated vegetables on top of sliced fruit like mango or papaya. Then heat it by popping it into your toaster oven. \\u200dAt home, buy packages of bacon and cook them in a pan until they\\'re crispy; let cool and eat as is or crumble over salads. You could also keep cooked bacon chilled and ready for snacking all week long using an ice cube tray. Boil an egg or two each Sunday afternoon and take out one per day during the week.\\u200d32. FreelancerPart-time freelance work is an excellent way for young entrepreneurs to start making a living from their ideas.

For that, you need an ambitious goal: turning it into a full-time gig within two years. \\u200dHere are some tips for how to do just that: Find out the service that you can be good at, estimate the costs and then start looking for the demand.

Electrician ServicesSmall business owners often overlook electrics, but electricians can help you improve your office comfort and productivity. However, don’t just bring any old electrician onto your property—choose a licensed professional who specializes in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) or electrical work. \\u200dYou should also consider hiring a company that can provide all of your HVAC/electrical needs so that you get one-stop shopping for all of your office comfort needs. The same goes for other services, such as plumbing or IT support.\\u200d35.

And keep in mind that you will likely want help from an accountant for everything from bookkeeping to filing taxes. Luckily there are plenty of online resources available for those just getting their small business ideas off of paper and into action.\\u200d\\u200d39. Web & App Developing ServiceWeb and App development is one great business idea. If you want to make money online, Web & app development is one way. We provide solutions for small businesses as well as large-scale business setups also. So, if you want to become a successful entrepreneur then it\\'s better to choose our services and see changes. Our Services Includes\\u200d40. Recruitment AgencyRecruitment agencies specialize in sourcing and hiring candidates for job openings. The work of a recruitment agency differs from an executive search firm because recruiters focus on finding employees for specific jobs, whereas headhunters try to fill entire leadership teams at once. \\u200dIf you’re looking for a new career opportunity, several startups can help, but it is important to find one that has appropriate licensing and accreditation. You can also consider launching your recruitment agency; while you will need to be licensed with relevant agencies like your state government, running such an agency takes little more than a few well-placed ads and some elbow grease (translation: clients). \\xa0\\u200dIt\\'s also worth noting that there are two types of recruiters - contingency recruiters and retainer recruiters.\\u200d41. Tax & Accounting ServiceIf you’re a do-it-yourself tax filer, why not make it easy on yourself? Hire a professional tax service and have peace of mind that your taxes are filed correctly. If you’re having trouble finding clients for your small business, think about signing up with an online aggregator, such as an accounting service or social media management company. \\u200dThis is also an opportunity to cross-sell additional services to your existing customers. Tax services can be surprisingly lucrative for self-employed individuals and pros often have more time on their hands than other professionals who charge by their hour.\\u200d42. Social Media InfluencerAnyone with a little bit of an online presence and a solid following is bound to be able to cash in on social media influence. There are all sorts of ways you can monetize your presence here, through branded content, affiliate marketing, social media optimization, and more. But don’t just take our word for it. \\xa0\\u200dResearch various agencies and determine which will best suit your goals (e.g., agency A specializes in branded content campaigns while agency B specializes in organic reach). Reach out and see how they can help you put your social media skills to work.\\u200d43. Drone Camera ServicesSince drones are getting so popular, you can buy a drone and start your own photography business. You can charge for wedding photos, and taking pictures of properties, scenery, and wildlife. Drones have quickly become one of the best ways to earn extra income from home. \\u200d44. Seasonal BusinessCreating a seasonal business is a great way to make money, but it’s also a ton of work. If you run, say, a Christmas tree lot, you can start that up right after New Year’s (maybe even opening early if there are some other Christmas tree lots on your street). Just be prepared for an influx of customers as soon as Halloween and Thanksgiving are over. \\xa0\\u200dOn one hand, that means more money. On the other hand, though: it will mean less time and less sleep because now you’re working through some of your busiest seasons.\\u200d45. Franchise for Popular BrandsFranchising is often a good way for aspiring entrepreneurs to get a business started with some backing. But it’s no guarantee of success—just ask any franchisee. Choose your franchisor carefully and understand what you’re getting into before making any decisions or writing any checks. \\u200dIf you plan on franchising, make sure you write a clear franchise disclosure document that lays out all details and fees involved. This will help ensure that both parties are operating from an informed position, helping avoid costly miscommunications down the road.\\u200d!function(o,c){var n=c.documentElement,t=\" w-mod-\";n.className+=t+\"js\",(\"ontouchstart\"in o||o.DocumentTouch&&c instanceof DocumentTouch)&&(n.className+=t+\"touch\")}(window,document);    ._600px {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  max-width: 700px;  margin: 0px auto;  padding: 16px 55px;  -webkit-box-pack: justify;  -webkit-justify-content: space-between;  -ms-flex-pack: justify;  justify-content: space-between;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;}.get-demo-buttom {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none;  color: #fff;  white-space: nowrap;}.button-inverse {  display: -webkit-box;  display: -webkit-flex;  display: -ms-flexbox;  display: flex;  width: 100%;  height: 60px;  max-width: 45%;  padding-right: 28px;  padding-left: 28px;  -webkit-box-pack: center;  -webkit-justify-content: center;  -ms-flex-pack: center;  justify-content: center;  -webkit-box-align: center;  -webkit-align-items: center;  -ms-flex-align: center;  align-items: center;  border: 1px solid #2e31be;  border-radius: 3px;  background-color: #fff;  color: #2e31be;  font-size: 18px;  font-weight: 700;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none; white-space: nowrap;}@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {  ._600px {    padding: 20px 16px;      }  .get-demo-buttom {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;      }  .button-inverse {    height: 48px;    max-width: 48%;    font-size: 16px;    white-space: nowrap;  }}  Get DemoStart for Free\\u200d46. DropshippingDo you have your own business? Not really. You have a shop window through which you can sell products or services, but do not have an inventory of those items or space for production. You drop ship these items from another source and thus, don’t hold any value. \\u200dSince there is no investment on your end, dropshipping is a great way to make money if you want to test out a product idea or market demand before going into heavy costs. One thing that’s worth noting here: It takes a lot of skill and hard work (or rather time) to find suppliers that will take on orders from individuals with no history as well as with no business credentials at all.\\u200d47. Aquariums And FishStarting an aquarium or fish farm is a fantastic business idea. You can either go for freshwater or saltwater aquariums. And you don’t even need much capital to start it. It is just like any other average shop; if your business grows big, you can also sell those fish online. \\u200d48. Online Shopping Store SectionsOnline shopping stores will be an integral part of your success, as customers will expect you to have them and come to you. There are two ways of looking at these and other such solutions; some look at the investment costs, while others look at long-term profits. \\u200dSome ask how long it will take them to break even, while others understand that revenue on day one is better than revenue on day five or ten.\\u200d49. Ice cubesHave you ever heard that everyone is getting out of hand in ice cubes? That’s because of their numerous health benefits. Ice cubes, made from melted water, have fewer calories and are more effective at keeping your foods and drinks relaxed than warmer alternatives like refrigerators or air conditioners. \\u200dIce cubes also come with many health benefits, as they can lower swelling caused by minor injuries and help soothe sore muscles after exercise.\\u200dConclusionDoing business is a dream for many and if you want to make your dream come true, start exploring our list of small business ideas.
